# System Routing

The routing of this system is based on the plugin [Elegant Router](https://github.com/soybeanjs/elegant-router). For detailed usage, please refer to the plugin documentation.

## Auto-generation

After starting the project, the plugin will automatically generate the src/router/elegant directory. The files in this directory are automatically generated files for route import, route definition, and route conversion.

## Configuration properties

### 1. type RouteKey

**Explanation:**

The union type RouteKey declares all route keys for easy unified management of routes. This type is automatically generated by the plugin [Elegant Router](https://github.com/soybeanjs/elegant-router) based on the page files under views.

### 2. type RoutePath

**Explanation:**

The path of the route, this type corresponds one-to-one with RouteKey

### 3. type RouteMeta

```typescript
// Route meta information interface
interface RouteMeta {
  /**
   * Route title
   *
   * Can be used in the document title
   */
  title: string;
  /**
   * The internationalization key of the route
   *
   * If set, it will be used for i18n, and the title will be ignored at this time
   */
  i18nKey?: App.I18n.I18nKey;
  /**
   * The role list of the route
   *
   * When the current user has at least one role, the route is allowed to be accessed. When the role list is empty, it means no permission is required
   */
  roles?: string[];
  /** Whether to cache this route */
  keepAlive?: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether it is a constant route
   *
   * No login is required, and the route is defined on the front end
   */
  constant?: boolean;
  /**
   * Iconify icon
   *
   * Can be used in the menu or breadcrumbs
   */
  icon?: string;
  /**
   * Local icon
   *
   * Located in the "src/assets/svg-icon" directory, if set, the icon property will be ignored
   */
  localIcon?: string;
  /** Route sorting order */
  order?: number;
  /** The external link of the route */
  href?: string;
  /** Whether to hide this route in the menu */
  hideInMenu?: boolean;
  /**
   * The menu key activated when entering this route
   *
   * This route is not in the menu
   *
   * @example
   *   Suppose the route is "user_detail", if set to "user_list", the "User List" menu item will be activated
   */
  activeMenu?: import('@elegant-router/types').RouteKey;
  /** By default, routes with the same path share a tab. If set to true, multiple tabs are used */
  multiTab?: boolean;
  /** If set, the route will be displayed fixed in the tab, and its value represents the order of the fixed tab */
  fixedIndexInTab?: number;
  /** if set query parameters, it will be automatically carried when entering the route */
  query?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

## Note

If you create a route page in views, call it elsewhere but do not show it in the menu, then you need to set `hideInMenu: true` in meta

```typescript
{
    name: '403',
    path: '/403',
    component: 'layout.blank$view.403',
    meta: {
      title: '403',
      i18nKey: 'route.403',
      hideInMenu: true
    }
}
```
